				<div class="descspace"><p> <br> My first project at NCN, Isola is a 2D point-and-click sidescroller following two detectives called in to investigate the disappearence of government documents in a foreign country on the brink of a civil war. Being my first project it suffered due to my lack of experience working to the given schedule. As a result it never quite reached the level of completion I had hoped for, eventually being cut down to a single chapter of what was to be a bigger narrative.	</p>
				<br>
				<p> The player controls Marco, a detective called in to the fictiobal European principality of Isola Grande along with his sidekick Gabriel who provides the player with comments that subtly guide the player to explore the game world. Following the opening in which the player is given some story and context they are free to explore the game environment as they choose, given no more information than what they themselve are able to discover by investigating.</p>

				<div class="descspace"><p> <br> These are some of the sprites I created for my game. Each of these was made using Adobe Photoshop and created to a specific size to import straight into Game Maker. Here you can see the frames used to animate them and their collision boxes denoted by the blue arrows. I drew them to contrast with the more refined looking backgrounds to mimic the style of old cartoons in which ink was layed over paintings.
